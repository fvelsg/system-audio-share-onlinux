# system-audio-share-onlinux
I needed a way to share my system audio in video calls so I developed an easy solution, and here it is.
Pipewire only



Tips for use:
- It works better for google meet because it removes the feedback, but the new functionality (No feedback) should work if the others don't.
- In microsoft teams you'll have problem with audio feedback, but you can control it using the volume control a muting and unmuting everytime you want the person to listen something or not, or you should try the new function "No feedback". It's still a little buggy though.

Future functionalities:
- Turn off the studio sound in google meet so the software works better for music;
